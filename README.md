# Spell Mapping
This is a project intended to automate the process of designing and drawing a spell map.

A pdf containing a homebrew wizard subclass for Dungeons & Dragons 5th Edition (5e) that details the rules, ability, and motivation for creating a spell map can be found in this repo and at this link: https://www.dmsguild.com/product/267026/School-of-Geometry

Please support the original creator of this idea by giving their work a look.
